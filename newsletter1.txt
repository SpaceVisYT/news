Hello.
My name is Joris, also known as "SpaceVis", "feesh" or even "Duolingoguy". I'm from the Netherlands and I'm 13 years old.
And I will be leaving Discord before I get banned.
Now, you're probably asking yourself: "Why would he get banned? 13 is the minimum age for Discord!"
Well yes, but actually no.
If I lived in the US or the UK, I would've been fine.
But for SOME STUPID REASON, you have to be 16+ to use Discord in the Netherlands.
And well, I've decided to stop lying about my age and to just straight up leave Discord.

But before that happens, I want to do a few more things. For example, I want to gather all of my friends in a group chat that IS accessible to me. Something like Guilded or similar. But also, venting. I have a lot of stuff in my life that I'm not content with.
And well, all of the info you'll ever need about me can be found in here. I'd really, REALLY appreciate it if you read this entire message, since there may be more important stuff here than you might realise.


=============== AGE RELATED YAPPING ================

Remember that I lied to Discord about my age? Well, Discord isn't the only one I lied to. Example: Google. I've lied about my age to Google as well. If I change my birthday to my actual birthday, I need to add my "child"-account to my dad's account. Easy enough. I'm alright with my dad being able to see some of the things I do. The problem: I have no idea if I can still do things like having a YouTube channel. Or log into games with that account. Pok√©mon Go, I'm looking at you. But on the other hand: I'm currently breaking Google's ToS. So I guess I have no choice but to accept my fate, whatever it will be.


============== SOCIAL RELATED YAPPING ==============

With Discord becoming a no-go very soon, I need some other way to socialize. I've got a friend group at school, but never really see them outside school. But don't worry, everyone! I've found the three perfect candidates for resocializing.

1. My little sister
Yeah, I have a sister. But I have this strange feeling that I'm not giving her enough attention. Enough GOOD attention. That'll be one of my focus points for the following weeks, months, years.

2. My primary-school-best friend 
I haven't really talked with him in over a year. Maybe it's time to just send him a message and get a social connection going again.

3. My primary-school-best friend (female version)
I'm actually still talking with her in my own Discord server. Oh wait, Discord's gone. Well, it's time to just start chatting again via WhatsApp or something.

So yeah, resocializing is a focus point for the following time.


============= PHYSIQUE RELATED YAPPING =============

It's not healthy to eat an entire bag of chips (or crisps or whatever) every single day. And yet I still do that. Well, that's gonna change. No more chips. No more candy smuggling. Just one or two candies a day. I also need to get my lazy ass off my bed and outside more often, and just do a 30-minute walk or something. I still belong in the category "healthy", but I honestly feel like I need to just do stuff like that more often to keep myself in that category.


================== OTHER YAPPING ===================

There are a few more things to this story than just this. Some of those things are things I would never want anyone on this entire planet to find out. (Don't worry, they aren't related to depression or self-harm.) Other things, I just forgor to add here. I'll make another update when I rember one of those.
Talking about updates, I'm gonna be releasing updates related to this stuff and other general yapping every 1-2 months. You can find them on this site!
Then, for the people who want to stay connected with me, and didn't send me a DM in time: send me an e-mail at 8p7zhag1e@mozmail.com (this'll send all mails straight to me without me having to worry about getting doxxed). I'll reply to you with a link to whatever I have figured out when the time comes. You can also just opt-in for a mailing list. If you do, I'll send you an e-mail every time I post an update. And don't worry, I will never leak any e-mail addresses and other personal information.
